# Text Processing  

(C) James Grant (r.j.grant@bath.ac.uk)

The repository contains exercises based around processing text from a file sourced from the web and designing some functions to mine it for data:

1. Read pages from the web
2. Open the file in `Python`
3. Write a function to automate this
