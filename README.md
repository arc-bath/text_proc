The repository contains exercises based around processing text from a file sourced from the web and designing some functions to mine it for data:

In an interactive session:

1. Read pages from the web
2. Open the file in `Python`
3. Read the file as a single string
4. Write a function `open_page(link)` to perform the, returning the page/file/link as a single string.

In a new library `web_text.py`:

5. Move this function in the file `web_text.py`
6. Write functions to count the number of words and specific occurrences of words in a string
7. Write a function to split a string each time a certain word or phrase is seen.
8. Modify the split function to return a subst of the split string.
9. Combine your functions to count the number of specific words in given subsets of the original string.

More detailed instructions about this exercise are available in the [Now Code lesson](https://arc-bath.github.io/now-code/04_episode.html).
